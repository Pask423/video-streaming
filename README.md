### **Running locally**

Before starting doing any changes I recommend to import project into IDE and then perform any changes from there.

To successfully run application locally you have to change first line in `stream` method inside `Streamer` object 
and change value of `path` variable. I have added small `.mp4` file to repository, so you can use it as test video.

Example
<br>
`val path = "path/to/file"` => `val path = "/path/to/project/test-video.mp4"`
